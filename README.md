# Enyo

This project uses Drools and the [BotHack](https://github.com/krajj7/BotHack) framework to create artificial intelligence capable of playing NetHack. The project uses Drools to model the inferences needed to progress through the game using rules.

## Shoulders of Giants

This project is only successful because of the [BotHack](https://github.com/krajj7/BotHack) framework made by @krajj7. The [BotHack](https://github.com/krajj7/BotHack) project is a framework for NetHack takes care of parsing the game screen, providing an abstract layer for performing actions, pathfinding, and item identification among many other things. Many thanks to @krajj7 for making Enyo a possibility.
